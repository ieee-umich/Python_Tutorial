**IEEE Python Tutorial**
==================

Welcome to the IEEE Python Tutorial, a hopefully growing tutorial on how to do somethings in Python. 

NOTE: The original author of this tutorial has a background in text-parsing, so the examples tend to be text-focused. 

#### **Preperations and Requirements**
This tutorial is written with Python 3 in mind, although I suppose if you change the few syntactical differences you can make it into a Python 2.x tutorial.

I've also tried to write this tutorial without having to install any additional python packages, since it's targeted towards beginners.

#### **Overview**
This is meant to be a tutorial as presented to crowd, so here's the general flow that I've come up with:

1. There's two basic basic syntax guides in the basics folder (1a, 1b), you just need to go through those depending on the level of your crowd. Obviously, like many guides this is a work in progress, so if you feel a part is lacking, feel free to add and modify. My personal favorite Python Primer ever is [here](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python3/).

2.  You can go through the beyond the basics after part 1 if you feel necessary, but the important topics inside of it should just be covered in turn as we go through part 3. This document mostly exists to cover some more "pythonic" things I feel are important as well as serve as another reference for anyone who wants to look at it after.

3.  Part 3 is a basic python script that takes the one of the files from part 1 and removes all the comments.  It's fairly simple, so you can either 

4.  Part 4 is a kind of "autograder" mostly using Python's built-in unit testing suite.
