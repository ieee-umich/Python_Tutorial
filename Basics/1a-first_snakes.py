# Python - From Zero to Hero



# Code is text, but it's text you pop into another program 
# (called either a compiler # or interpreter) that let's you run it and do something
# Python is a language that uses an interpreter
# These are comments, which your interpreter ignores
# Every Language does comments differently, but in python if a line has '#' infront of it, it's a comment

###### Variables and Data Types ###########################################################################

# A program, does something it can really be anything!
# To do this, you're going to need variables, which are containers for values
# You can name them whatever you want!
variable_name = True
this_is_a_variable = 2
number_of_dogs = 3.0
do_you_see_a_pattern = "maybe"

you_can_over_write_variables_after_declaring_then_as_well = 1 
you_can_over_write_variables_after_declaring_then_as_well = 2
# The Value of the variable "you_can_over_write_variables_after_declaring_then_as_well" will now be 2

# okay, so you might be wondering what these variables can be holding?
# Prepare for a couple definitions: Unfortunately, you just gotta memorize them
# these are your data types:


# Integers
integer_example1 = 0
integer_example2 = 1
# These are whole numbers going from -infinity to infinity

# Floats
float_example1 = 1.0
float_example2 = 2.0
float_example3 = 3.23424
#These are decimal numbers

# Strings
string_example1 = "words using the latin alphabet"
string_example2 = "they can be super duper...duper long"
string_example3 = "or"
string_example4 = "short"
string_example5 = "!"
an_empty_string = ""
# You can put most alpha-numeric characters and most of the the rest of the characters 
# on your keyboard, but there are some exceptions

# Booleans (True and False)
boolean1 = True
boolean2 = False
# Booleans simply carry the value of "True" or "False," this will become relevant in a bit
# when you can tell a program to do something if a variable is True or False

# Lists
a_list_of_numbers = [1,2,3,4]
a_list_of_words = ["hi", "I'm", "Jennings", "How", "are", "you", "?"]
a_list_of_floats = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
a_list_of_bools = [True, True, False, False]
a_list_of_multiple_things = ["one", 2, 3.0]
# In python, Lists (or as they are generally called across programming languages: Arrays) are just that:
# lists of things, there are many rules for lists and their parallel structures in each language
# Just know that in python, lists can lists of anything


##### Operators ###########################################################################################
# Now that we have the individual tools available to us, we might want to actually perform operations of them:
addition = 1 + 1 
subtraction = 24.4 - 43.0
division = 2.0 / 34.0
multiplication = 4*0
modulus = 9%2 #Modulus gives you the remainder of 9/2, so 9%2 = 1

###### Control Statements #################################################################################
# Alright, so now we have all these fancy variables and containers for them, how do we actually do this
# "Programming" Business? Well let's introduce if/else statements via a couple examples below:

if True:
	#Do Something
else:
	#Do something Else


condition = True
if condition


###### Loops ##############################################################################################

###### Functions ##########################################################################################
# Functions are really the bread and butter of coding

if __name__ == "__main__":
	if []:
		print("green")
